# ALTO — Crystalbound Battlegrounds

ALTO is a custom-built 3D-enhanced tactical card battler made with React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, and React Three Fiber. It blends a traditional lane-based card game structure with modern presentation using 3D card meshes and a stylized fantasy theme.

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- Turn-based system
- Lane-based board with three combat lanes
- Mana system (“Alt Shards”), max 10
- Player hand with card draw
- Playing unit cards onto the board
- ATK / HP stats and future combat logic
- End Turn button and turn progression

### Visual & UI Systems
- 3D card meshes with custom fantasy card frames
- Static board background art rendered in 2D
- 3D hand of cards positioned using React Three Fiber
- Lane highlighting
- Future additions: card animations, battle effects, hover highlights

### Engine / Architecture
- Zustand game store for synchronous game state
- Pure game logic in src/core (rules, turn system, card definitions)
- Presentation layer in src/ui (3D, layout, hand, scene)
- Clean separation between state, rules, and rendering

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Zustand
- React Three Fiber
- Three.js
